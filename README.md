⚡ Power System Fault Detection & Classification
This project focuses on detecting and classifying power system faults using machine learning models such as Random Forest and SVM. The goal is to distinguish between normal and fault conditions (like line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults) using electrical measurements such as voltage and current phasors.
